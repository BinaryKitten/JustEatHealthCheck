# Just Eat Health Check

User Script/GreaseMonkey script to fetch the food hygiene rating for UK takeaways. It displays the food hygiene graphic on search results and restaurant menus. 

Some restaurants don't match up correctly due to the data on ratings.food.gov.uk being different to Just Eat. This is usually the case when the address is different or they have different trading names. When this happens it will give you a link to search on the same postcode directly on the rating site.

Sometimes the ratings website is slow to respond, so be patient; the script will cache results for each restaurant in your browser for each subsequent page refresh.

This is a re-write of a Google Chrome extension that is no longer maintained, and no longer works.
